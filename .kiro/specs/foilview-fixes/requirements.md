# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The foilview application is experiencing initialization and loading issues that prevent it from functioning properly. The application starts but encounters errors with ScanImage connection and fails to complete the loading process. This feature addresses these critical issues to ensure reliable application startup and operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the foilview application to start reliably without errors, so that I can use the microscope control interface immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `foilview` THEN the application SHALL start without throwing unhandled exceptions
2. WHEN ScanImage is not available THEN the application SHALL gracefully fall back to simulation mode without errors
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all UI components SHALL be properly initialized and visible
4. WHEN the application encounters initialization errors THEN it SHALL display helpful error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ScanImage connection to be handled robustly, so that the application works both with and without ScanImage installed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ScanImage is available THEN the application SHALL connect successfully and enable full functionality
2. WHEN ScanImage is not available THEN the application SHALL enter simulation mode with mock data
3. WHEN ScanImage connection fails THEN the application SHALL retry connection with exponential backoff
4. WHEN in simulation mode THEN all controls SHALL remain functional with simulated responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application UI to load completely and be responsive, so that I can interact with all controls immediately after startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all UI panels SHALL be visible and properly sized
2. WHEN the application loads THEN all buttons and controls SHALL be enabled and responsive
3. WHEN the window is resized THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately without callback warnings
4. WHEN the application is ready THEN the status SHALL indicate "Ready" or "Connected"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN initialization fails THEN the specific failure point SHALL be identified in logs
3. WHEN the application recovers from errors THEN recovery actions SHALL be logged
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN detailed diagnostic information SHALL be available
