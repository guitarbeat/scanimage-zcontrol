**Key improvements**:
- Accurate installation and usage instructions
- Comprehensive API reference for both classes
- Detailed ScanImage integration explanation
- Practical examples and troubleshooting
- Updated file organization and configuration info

### 2. **Z-Stage_Control_Documentation.md - Completion and Accuracy**
**Problem**: Document was incomplete (cut off mid-sentence) and had some inaccuracies
**Solution**: Completed the documentation with proper conclusion and updated technical details

**Key improvements**:
- Completed unfinished sections
- Added missing workflow examples
- Updated file structure and line counts
- Added comprehensive conclusion section
- Fixed technical specifications

### 3. **Source Code Documentation - Added Comprehensive Inline Docs**

#### ZStageController.m
**Problem**: Minimal class-level documentation
**Solution**: Added comprehensive class documentation including:
- Detailed class description and purpose
- Key features overview
- Usage examples
- Events documentation
- Comprehensive property and constant documentation with explanations

#### ZStageControlApp.m  
**Problem**: Basic class comment only
**Solution**: Added extensive documentation including:
