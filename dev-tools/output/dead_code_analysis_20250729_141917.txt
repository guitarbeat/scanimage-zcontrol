ANALYSIS SUMMARY
----------------
Total functions defined: 446
Total unique function calls: 544
Classes detected: 21
Protected functions: 25
Suspicious functions: 0
Potentially unused functions: 0
Code health score: 100% (446/446 functions actively used)

POTENTIALLY UNUSED FUNCTIONS
----------------------------
No unused functions detected! ðŸŽ‰

PROTECTED FUNCTIONS (Safe from Removal)
---------------------------------------
These functions are automatically protected:

â€¢ ApplicationInitializer (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ BookmarkManager (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ BookmarksView (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ ErrorHandlerService (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ FoilviewController (File entry point)
â€¢ MetricCalculationService (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ PlotManager (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ ScanImageManager (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ StageControlService (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ StageView (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ UIController (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ UserNotificationService (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ add (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ build (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ clear (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ debug (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ delete (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ error (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ foilview (Class constructor, File entry point)
â€¢ get (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ info (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ initialize (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ log (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ remove (MATLAB builtin function)
â€¢ smoothData (MATLAB builtin function)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Review potentially unused functions before removal
2. Search for dynamic calls (feval, str2func) for suspicious functions
3. Test thoroughly after removing any functions
4. Consider code coverage tools for verification
