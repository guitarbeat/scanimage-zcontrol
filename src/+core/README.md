# Core Module Refactoring Documentation

This document describes the recent refactoring of the core module components to improve code organization, reduce duplication, and enhance maintainability.

## Major Improvements

1. **Added CoreUtils Class**
   - Created a utility class for shared functionality
   - Extracted common error handling, GUI validation, and status updates
   - Reduced code duplication across multiple classes

2. **Improved Constructor Patterns**
   - FocalParameters now accepts parameter/value pairs in constructor
   - Standardized parameter parsing across classes
   - Simplified component initialization in FocalSweep

3. **Refactored FocalSweep Constructor**
   - Split the large constructor into smaller, focused methods
   - Simplified error handling and initialization flow
   - Reduced nesting depth of try-catch blocks
   - Better component cleanup on errors

4. **Optimized Validation Logic**
   - Created reusable GUI validation method
   - Eliminated duplicate validation checks
   - Simplified code for checking component validity

5. **Standardized Error Handling**
   - Created a consistent approach to error management
   - Eliminated duplicate error handling code
   - Improved error reporting

## Affected Classes

- **CoreUtils**: New utility class for shared functionality
- **FocalParameters**: Improved constructor and parameter handling
- **FocalSweep**: Major refactoring for improved organization
- **Initializer**: Simplified with shared error handling
- **FocalSweepFactory**: Updated instance validation logic

## Additional Improvements
- Removed redundant methods
- Improved code organization
- Enhanced documentation
- Reduced cyclomatic complexity

## Future Improvements
- Consider refactoring the excessive delegation pattern
- Implement more robust component lifecycle management
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms
- Consider using MATLAB's event system for component communication
