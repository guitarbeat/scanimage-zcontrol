# Prompt Optimization Rules

## Core Issues to Check

### 1. Contradictions
- Two clauses that cannot both be followed
- Examples: "Only positive numbers" + "Include negatives"

### 2. Format Issues  
- Missing output specifications
- Unclear data types/structures
- Incomplete templates

### 3. Few-Shot Inconsistencies
- Examples don't follow prompt rules
- Models learn from examples over rules

## How to Use with AI Assistants

### Request Templates
```
"Check this prompt for:
1. Contradictions
2. Format issues  
3. Missing specs
4. Ambiguous instructions"

"Optimize this prompt by:
1. Identify issues
2. Provide improved version
3. Explain changes"
```

### Complete Template
```
Please optimize this prompt:

**Original:** [prompt]
**Use Case:** [purpose]
**Examples:** [if any]
**Concerns:** [worries]

Please:
1. Identify issues
2. Provide improved version
3. Explain changes
4. Validate fixes
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Define exact requirements
2. **Be Consistent**: All parts work together
3. **Be Complete**: Include all specs
4. **Be Clear**: Avoid ambiguity
5. **Be Tested**: Validate with examples

## Common Fixes

- **Contradictions**: Choose one approach consistently
- **Format Issues**: Define complete schema with types
- **Inconsistencies**: Update examples to match rules
