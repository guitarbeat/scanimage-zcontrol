ENHANCED DEAD CODE ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================
Generated: 15-Jul-2025 19:02:55

ANALYSIS SUMMARY
----------------
Total functions defined: 304
Total unique function calls: 460
Classes detected: 17
Protected functions: 10
Suspicious functions: 0
Potentially unused functions: 2

POTENTIALLY UNUSED FUNCTIONS
----------------------------
These functions are defined but no calls were detected:

• clear
  └─ MetricsPlotService.m (line 107, method in class MetricsPlotService)

• error
  └─ FoilviewUtils.m (line 110, method in class FoilviewUtils)

PROTECTED FUNCTIONS (Safe from Removal)
---------------------------------------
These functions are automatically protected:

• BookmarkManager (Class constructor, File entry point)
• BookmarksView (Class constructor, File entry point)
• FoilviewController (Class constructor, File entry point)
• PlotManager (Class constructor, File entry point)
• ScanImageManager (Class constructor, File entry point)
• StageView (Class constructor, File entry point)
• UIController (Class constructor, File entry point)
• delete (MATLAB special method)
• foilview (Class constructor, File entry point)
• get (MATLAB special method)

CALL PATTERN ANALYSIS
---------------------
• callback calls: 31
• method calls: 525
• regular calls: 1460
• static calls: 289

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. SAFE TO REMOVE: Functions in "Potentially Unused" section
2. REVIEW CAREFULLY: Functions in "Suspicious" section
3. DO NOT REMOVE: Functions in "Protected" section
4. Check for dynamic calls using feval() or str2func()
5. Verify callback functions are not referenced in UI code
6. Consider if functions are part of public API

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review each unused function manually
2. Search codebase for string references to function names
3. Check if functions are called from external scripts
4. Remove confirmed dead code in small, testable commits
5. Run tests after each removal to ensure nothing breaks

NOTE: This enhanced analysis reduces false positives but manual
verification is still recommended before removing any code.
